            <img src="karli-and-athena.JPG" alt="Karli Stites with her Yorkshire Terrier, Athena." width="250" height="500">

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>Karli Stites works as a Content Designer at Microsoft in Atlanta, Georgia. She graduated from Georgia Tech with a BS Computer Science and has a strong technical background, but she soon transitioned to a more creative position when she moved into technical writing. Currently, Karli is pursuing a MS in Learning Design and Technology with an expected graduation date of December 2022.</p>

            <h2>Author details</h2>

            <p>Karli is a tech nerd by day (and also by night), so she did the only thing she could when faced with an overload of creativity that had nowhere to go: she started writing books! She published her first book in May 2019 and she hasn't looked back since. As of July 2022, she's been in six self-published anthologies with other independent writers and has two self-published books of her own. She's very passionate about the indie community and is happy to help new authors get started on their journey!</p>

            <h2>Fun facts</h2>

            <p>If Karli isn't reading or writing, you can catch her cuddling with her fur babies, Athena, Major, and Crookshanks, or playing XBOX.</p>
