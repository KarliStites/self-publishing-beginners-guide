                <h1>HOW TO PUBLISH YOUR MANUSCRIPT ON AMAZON</h1>
            </div>

            <p>There are six steps to publishing an eBook in the Amazon Kindle store for the first time.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Set up your Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) account.</li>
                <li>Sign into Kindle Direct Publishing.</li>
                <li>Enter your book details.</li>
                <li>Enter your book content details.</li>
                <li>Enter your book pricing details.</li>
                <li>Publish your book.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 1: Set up your KDP account</h2>

            <p>If you already have an Amazon account, you can sign into KDP with your existing username and password. If you don't have an Amazon account, you'll have to <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="create a KDP account (opens in a new tab).">create a KDP account</a> from the KDP landing page.</p> After you have a KDP account, you can set it up. Before you can publish anything in the Kindle store, you'll need to enter the following information:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Author or publisher information:</strong> this includes information like your name, a publishing company (if you have one), and your mailing address.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment details:</strong> you'll need to provide information on how you want to be paid. The suggested method is direct deposit, but Amazon also offers wire transfer and check. <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G200641050" target="_blank" aria-label="Learn more about KDP payment options (opens in a new tab).">Learn more about KDP payment options</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax information:</strong> <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G201274750" target="_blank" aria-label="the KDP tax interview (opens in a new tab).">the KDP tax interview</a> will help you fill out the necessary tax information you'll need to provide to be compliant with US regulations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 2: Sign in to KDP</h2>

            <p>After you sign in, you're taken to your Bookshelf. This page lets you manage any existing titles you have or publish new ones. To get started, select <strong>Create</strong>.</p>

            <img src="kdp-dashboard.png" alt="Kindle Direct Publishing dashboard screen capture with Create button.">

            <h3>What are you creating?</h3>

            <p>After you select <strong>Create</strong>, you'll come to another screen where you'll find four options to choose from:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Kindle eBook</li>
                <li>Paperback</li>
                <li>Series page</li>
                <li>Kindle Vella</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this guide, I'll be explaining how to publish a Kindle eBook, however, you can also <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G202172740" target="_blank" aria-label="publish your manuscript as a paperback (opens in a new tab).">publish your manuscript as a paperback</a> or <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/GR2L4AHPMQ44HNQ7" target="_blank" aria-label="publish serialized stories with Kindle Vella (opens in a new tab).">publish serialized stories with Kindle Vella</a>. You can also <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/GMFKBUS43QQ5AJ5A" target="_blank" aria-label="start a book series (opens in a new tab).">start a book series</a> to organize books you publish.</p>

            <p>To continue creating an eBook, select <strong>Create eBook</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Enter your book details</h2>

            <p>The first part of creating your book involves entering your book details. This includes the following information:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Language</li>
                <li>Book title</li>
                <li>Series (optional)</li>
                <li>Edition number (optional)</li>
                <li>Author</li>
                <li>Contributors (optional)</li>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Publishing rights</li>
                <li>Keywords (optional)</li>
                <li>Categories</li>
                <li>Age and grade range (optional)</li>
                <li>Pre-order (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'll go into detail about a few of the more important areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Book title:</strong> please keep in mind that this can't be changed after you publish your book!</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> while you are required to use your real name when you set up your Amazon account, you can use a pen name in this section to show up when you publish your book.</p>

            <p><strong>Publishing rights:</strong> this section lets you indicate if you own the copyright or the book is public domain work.</p>

            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> choose up to seven keywords to help people find your book on Amazon.</p>

            <p><strong>Categories:</strong> choose two browse categories to help people find your book on Amazon.</p>

            <p><strong>Pre-order:</strong> you can list your book for up to one year before you plan to publish it so people can pre-purchase it. Alternatively, you can decide to publish it immediately. In this case, it can take up to 72 hours to publish.</p>

            Go to the KDP Help Center to <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G202105800" target="_blank" aria-label="read more about the book details page (opens in a new tab).">read more about the book details page</a>.

            <h2>Step 4: Enter your book content details</h2>

            <p>The book content details page only has a few sections to it, but it might take a while if you don't have your formatting correct.</p>

            <h3>Upload your manuscript</h3>

            <p>Before you upload your manuscript, you have to decide if you want to enable Digital Rights Management (DRM) for your Kindle eBook. DRM inhibits unauthorized distribution of your eBook.</p>

            <p>After you decide on your DRM setting, it's time to upload your manuscript! The recommended formats for Kindle eBooks are DOCX, EPUB, and KPF, which can be created on a variety of platforms. <a href="faq.html" target="_parent">Go to FAQs for more information on manuscript formatting</a>.</p>

            <h3>Upload your book cover</h3>

            <p>Upload a cover according to <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G200645690" target="_blank" aria-label="Amazon's cover guidelines (opens in a new tab).">Amazon's cover guidelines</a>. You can create a cover using Amazon's Cover Creator, create a cover using a different platform like Microsoft Publisher, or work with a cover designer</p>

            <h3>Preview your book</h3>

            <p>Check if your eBook is formatted correctly using the Kindle eBook online previewer. If something doesn't look right, you might have to go back to your manuscript and reformat something. Make sure to <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/GU72M65VRFPH43L6" target="_blank" aria-label="check the Kindle publishing guidelines (opens in a new tab).">check the Kindle publishing guidelines</a>.</p>

            <h3>Kindle eBook ISBN</h3>

            Optionally, you can enter an ISBN, however, Kindle eBooks aren't required to have one. You'll be assigned an ASIN from Amazon.

            <h2>Step 5: Enter your book pricing details</h2>

            <p>The final page is all about money and how you want to get paid. Here, you'll need to decide if you want to enroll with KDP Select, choose the territories where you hold distribution rights, choose your primary marketplace, select a royalty plan, and set a price for your eBook.</p>

            <h3>KDP Select</h3>

            <p>When you enroll in KDP Select, your book becomes part of the Kindle Unlimited program. It's meant to help you earn higher royalties, reach new audiences, and maximize your sales potential. <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G200798990" target="_blank" aria-label="Learn more about KDP Select here (opens in a new tab).">Learn more about KDP Select here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Territories and primary marketplace</h3>

            <p>Select whether you hold worldwide distribution rights or if you only hold distribution rights in individual territories.</p>

            <p>Then, choose the location where you expect you'll make the majority of your book sales. For example, <em>Amazon.com</em> is my primary marketplace.</p>

            <h3>Royalties and pricing</h3>

            <p>Choose between the 35% or 70% royalty plan. <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/G200644210" target="_blank" aria-label="Read more about royalty plans (opens in a new tab).">Read more about royalty plans</a>.</p>

            <p>Then, set a price for your book. Amazon will give you a comparison between what the royalty would be for the 35% royalty plan versus the 70% royalty plan for your chosen list price for your primary marketplace.</p>

            <p>If you select the 70% royalty plan, you're required to enroll in the Kindle Book Lending program, which lets people lend a Kindle eBook to friends and family for up to 14 days. You can also enroll in this if you choose the 35% royalty plan.</p>

            <h2>Step 6: Publish your eBook</h2>

            <p>Select <strong>Publish Your Kindle eBook</strong> to submit your eBook for publishing. After this, it can take up to 72 hours for your book to be available in the Kindle store. But, be ready, because you're almost a published author!</p>
