            <h2>What is self-publishing?</h2>

            <p>It's simple. Self-publishing just means that you decided you want to distribute your work by yourself. What does that mean? <strong>You're in charge.</strong> 
        
            <h3>Pros</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>You control everything.</strong> Whether you use an editor to whether you create the cover design by yourself. You control how you create the book.</li>
                <li><strong>All your profits are yours.</strong> Except for a small percentage taken by the self-publishing service that you use, you keep everything.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>However, there are a few drawbacks as well.</p>

            <h3>Cons</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>You have to pay for everything.</strong> Since you're not working with a publishing house, you have to front all the costs. However, the pro to this is that you retain more profits.</li>
                <li><strong>You're responsible for marketing.</strong> Another great positive of working with a publishing company is the brand and marketing that they help you with to get you into bookstores. When you're self-publishing, you have to do all of this yourself, and it takes a lot of time to get started and build up a brand.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some people will prefer to send out their manuscript in hopes of getting a publishing contract, but others may just want to go for it and self-publish their novel. It all comes down to what's important to you as an author. <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/traditional-publishing-vs-self-publishing#1UFFyS6SnKvj2eqgYg46mv" target="_blank" aria-label="Read more about the pros and cons of self-publishing here (opens in a new tab).">Read more about the pros and cons of self-publishing here</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Self-publishing vs. Traditional publishing</h2>
                    <p>The comparison shows that self-publishing and traditional publishing work with much of the same experts, but traditional publishing experts are all contained within a publishing house, while self-publishing experts are generally freelance separate entities. Experts on the self-publishing side include a professional freelance editor, professional freelance cover designer, crowd-sourced editors or beta readers, market research subjects for cover design, freelance public relations, and research subjects or promoters. The self-publishing house then contains production, printing, ebook experts, and sales teams, which is conntected to distributors, booksellers, and libraries. On the traditional publishing side, the publishing house has everything the self-publishing house has, but also includes the editors, cover designer, and marketing and public relations department. There is less autonomy. <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/polly-courtney/self-publishing-why-john-green-has-got-it-wrong_b_3435069.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Read the full Huffington Post article (opens in a new tab).">Read the full Huffington Post article</a> to learn more about the difference between self-publishing and traditional publishing.</p>
